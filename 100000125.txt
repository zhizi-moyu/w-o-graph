The horizontal arm is a flat elongated base with a cylindrical pin protruding downward near one end. The pin appears to be integrated into the base and is likely used for rotational or locking purposes. The inner corner of the L-shape is smoothly filleted for structural strength. The entire component appears to be a single molded or machined piece, likely used as a mounting or guiding bracket in a mechanical assembly.'
